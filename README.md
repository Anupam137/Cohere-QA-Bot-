# Question Answering Bot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Question Answering (QA) bot that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The bot retrieves relevant information from a dataset and generates coherent answers using the Cohere API and Pinecone as a vector database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anupam137/Cohere-QA-Bot.git
   cd repo-name
   
2.Install the required packages:
   Mentioned inside notebook

3.Set up your API keys:
  Replace YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY and YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY in the code with your actual API keys.

4. Run the notebook.


##Model Architecture
The QA bot consists of two main components:

Retrieval: Uses Pinecone to store and retrieve document embeddings.
Generation: Uses Cohere to generate answers based on retrieved documents and user queries.
#How It Works
Data Loading: The bot loads and preprocesses a dataset (e.g., Wikipedia articles).
Embedding Generation: It generates embeddings for the documents using Cohere's embedding API.
Storage: The embeddings are stored in Pinecone for efficient retrieval.
Query Processing: When a user inputs a query, the bot retrieves relevant document embeddings.
Answer Generation: The bot uses the retrieved texts to generate a coherent answer.

#Example Queries

Query: "What is machine learning?"

Output: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions..."

Query: "Explain the concept of deep learning."

Output: "Deep learning is a class of machine learning based on neural networks with many layers, capable of learning representations from data with multiple levels of abstraction..."
